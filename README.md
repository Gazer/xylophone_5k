## Getting Started

This Xylphone was development for the Flutter Create contest. The idea is to
create an app less than 5K bytes of Dart code using the Flutter framework.

For more information check the contest page: https://flutter.dev/create

Once you run the app just ensure you volume is up and start playing.

If unsure what to play, just hit the 'try me' button and learn a new song.

## Sounds

All notes were recorded by me using my doter's Xylophone. I've used Audacity
for OSX with my Novik NEO FNK O2U USB microphone. Each sound has the drumstick
sound too so it feels more real :).
